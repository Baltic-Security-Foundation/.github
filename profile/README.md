The Baltic Security Foundation (BSF) is a think tank established in 2019, that promotes the security and defense of the Baltic Sea region. The Foundation is a result of the Baltic Security Strategy Project (2017-2019) that gathered experts on defence, societal security and economic security to assess the shared challenges for the Baltic States and recommend solutions.

We are an open society of experts, students, academics and professionals looking to apply their knowledge. If you're interested in joining as a volunteer or expert, don't hesitate to contact us!

## About the Hub

One of the main problems faced in the Baltics is the lack of organizations providing, collecting and analysing raw data. While other organizations such as LATO, NATO Stratcom and CCDCoE and CRI already fill the gap of policy making and in-depth analysis, we realized there was a gap in making the data that dictated the decision making.

A visualization of the relations between the organizations in the Baltics can be seen below.
