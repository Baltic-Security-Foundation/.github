The Baltic Security Foundation (BSF) is a think tank established in 2019, that promotes the security and defense of the Baltic Sea region. The Foundation is a result of the Baltic Security Strategy Project (2017-2019) that gathered experts on defence, societal security and economic security to assess the shared challenges for the Baltic States and recommend solutions.

We are an open society of experts, students, academics and professionals looking to apply their knowledge. If you're interested in joining as a volunteer or expert, don't hesitate to contact us!

## About the Hub 🖥️

One of the main problems faced in the Baltics is the lack of organizations providing, collecting and analysing raw data. While other organizations such as LATO, NATO Stratcom and CCDCoE and CRI already fill the gap of policy making and in-depth analysis, we realized there was a gap in making the data that dictated the decision making. A visualization of the relations between the organizations in the Baltics can be seen below:

The basis for the Baltic Security Hub is the October 2019 internal memo "BSF Discussion about Computer Software" which presented, among the technical assets of BSF including the need of Information Security (InfoSec) of the BSF team, the need to expand the discussion of Libre Software, but its initial implementation started in 2022 as the topic of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) started to be analyzed.¹

Thus, in 2022/2023 we plan to implement and expand the idea of the Baltic Security Hub further, inviting technophiles to help us create and mantain databases, curate "bite-sized" OSINT analysis and help create a community in the Baltics.

In 2023, we expect to host the "BaltSec" conference in Riga.
